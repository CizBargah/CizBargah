# Who am I?
I’m @CizBargah.  
I was a average depressed ex-student majoring in mathematics. 
Currently, I'm studying deeper about Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, and others to add to my depression.  
I am a nerd and a geek (in case its not obvious enough).  

# What do I like?
I play video games like Reverse 1999, Wuthering Waves, Terraria, and Minecraft.  
I occassionally upload youtube videos at https://www.youtube.com/@cizbargahyt.  
I like pizza and coffee.  
I like comedy.
